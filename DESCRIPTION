Description: 
  Computes a confidence interval for a specified linear combination of the 
  regression parameters in a linear regression model with iid normal errors
  with known variance when there is uncertain prior information that a distinct
  specified linear combination of the regression parameters takes a given 
  value.  This confidence interval, found by numerical constrained optimization, has the
  required minimum coverage and utilizes this uncertain prior information 
  through desirable expected length properties.
  This confidence interval has the following three practical applications. Firstly, 
  if the error variance has been accurately estimated from previous data 
  then it may be treated as being effectively known. Secondly, for 
  sufficiently large (dimension of the response vector) minus (dimension of 
  regression parameter vector), greater than or equal to 30 (say),
  if we replace the assumed known value of the error variance by its usual estimator
  in the formula for the confidence interval then the resulting interval has, to a very 
  good approximation, the same coverage probability and expected length properties 
  as when the error variance is known. Thirdly, some more complicated models can be 
  approximated by the linear regression model with error variance known when certain 
  unknown parameters are replaced by estimates.
